extra neat things in carto

sql queries - customize the data that you want to display on the map; 


You can customize your searches and the data that you want to display:

select CDB_LatLng(41.51, -81.63) <-> the_geom as dist, * from wlrc order by 1 limit 20

select * from wlrc where ward = '11'

Show them Torque with the cleveland demolitions;

MOST MAPS:

Data conversion or need to quickly create the data: 


What format is your data in? 
http://jeffpaine.github.io/geojson-topojson/

http://mapshaper.org/

geojson to SHP; 

Geojson 
- doesn't compress very well 
- can be read + served over the web 
- PLAIN Text - can be manipulated 
- JSON 
- doesn't compress very well 



SHP
 - compresses somewhat well, has good support all over; 
 - can't serve it over the internet
 - 
 - contains multiple files 
  - dbf 
  - cpg describes the encoding
  -

+ can't be served over the web; 


- geojson.io 
  - exports to SHP/GEOJSON/WHATEVER ELSE

But remember: 

although the potential has increased greatly with these 
new tools; 

1] the limitations of the technology used to create the map
- you're still limited by them (barrier if you don't know how to code, is smaller; 
but )

Who is the intended audience for this map?
Which data will best communicate these things?
What are the one to five things I want this map to communicate clearly?
Which design elements will help the map user receive the message
most clearly?

Choropleth maps
- show data differences between 
should only be used to represent standardized data (e.g., percentages, rates,
people per square mile 
- not for absolute numbers 

YOU WILL GET misleading 
 

(SHOW the election map)

also here is where I can change it from polygon to a centroid.  


When not carto: 

- You want to custom the background base map; 
- different interface to style your data that you upload 

- vector maps 

- mapbox has more robust documentation; 
plenty of plugins for the advanced folks; 

When you need a quick map: 

For reference: 



why web maps: 

- the content can be updated dynamically 

 - the style can be changed based on qualities of the data 
 - any changes in roads can be shown: 

But you're still interested: 

So, what tool to use besides carto: 

Carto is good: 

- has built in clustering; 
- built in 

MapBox: 

- Base maps, can be custom styled. 

 - Pitching: 
  - (map position)
  - easily export to an image if you'd like

QGIS: 

- Good if you have a LOT Of information; 
- Especially if you want to make a print; 
- 
- a swiss army knife 
- Printing maps, tres bon


Mapzen: 

- sharp learning curve; pushing the bounds of what your maps can look like;

==================================
Aesthetics: 

Lighter colors rarely go wrong (like a neutral gray) for a base color in the background; 
- makes your map/data pop out a little bit more; 

- or if you have light colors for your icons and dark for 

- don't use serif fonts (the little doo-hickeys)

no more than 2 fonts in a map; 

for choropleth
