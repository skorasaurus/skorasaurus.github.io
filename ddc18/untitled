I took a geojson file from overpass-turbo  (export-overpass.geojson)

deleted a couple points from it and then took it to geojson.io ; drew more polygons on it; and exported it from geojson.io.  (export.geojson)

when i opened in mapshaper.org - only 2 polygons (the ones that i drew in geojson.io) display although all of the polygons are correctly detected by mapshaper; if I go to export; all 242 polygons are found. 

I've ensured it's valid by geojsonlint.com https://gist.github.com/skorasaurus/cebe4936e2154de52afc91817a2085ac 

did export-withidfield-deleted.geojson
where i deleted the id field from export.geojson; 

oh, but when the special-style features are null; then it isn't rendered.
