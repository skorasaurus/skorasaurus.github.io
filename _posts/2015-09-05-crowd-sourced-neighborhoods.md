Where is your neighborhood? What is its name? You can likely quickly answer this but 

Where does a neighborhood's boundary begin and end? Is this boundary fuzzy for you? 

Even if we mention the names of a neighb. The neighborhood names will change from person to person. 


In Cleveland, neighborhoods' boundaries are largely left to the imaginations of residents, visitors, realtors, businesses, and non-profits. 

This is enabling you people to share perspective of where their neighborhood is; hasn't 

The City Planning Commission's Statistical Planning Areas, adopted in early 2000s. These names are argely ignored and not widely adopted with good reason, they are missing and many of the names there . 

Here's your chance to say where your neighborhood is and view what others hve shared. 

**Map Your Neighborhood in Cleveland and Akron at [http://skorasaur.us/nh](http://skorasaur.us/nh)**


You're encouraged to map (that is draw) the neighborhood where you live but others that you may not live in but may spend a lot of time in or feel strongly about. 

No neighborhood or city boundaries are present on the map; to remove biases and to encourage boundaries across city lines. 

With projects like [http://openstreetmap.org](OpenStreetMap) and improved technology and software, mapping is not only a noun, but it is being used as a verb - creating and modifying what is (or isn't) on a map - the canvas representing a space. 


After you've mapped a neighborhood, view what others have drawn.

I hope this sparks a conversation of neighborhood identity in each of you. 

Thanks to work of [Nick Martinelli](http://pnwmaps.com/neighborhoods/) and [Andy Woodruff and Tim Wallace at Bostonography](http://bostonography.com/2015/map-your-neighborhood-again/), I've been able to build upon their work and customize it for Cleveland.

Identifying neighborhoods has fascinated me for some time and inspired me to create my first map - [my (incomplete) interpretation of Cleveland's neighborhoods](https://skorasaurus.wordpress.com/cleveland-neighborhood-map/), in 2010-2011.

To make your own instance for a city, the source code and directions are available on [github](https://github.com/enam/neighborhoods/). I've made a couple adjustments (like directions) that I'll be shortly adding.
