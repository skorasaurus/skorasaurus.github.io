Where does a neighborhood's boundary begin and end; What does a neighborhood's name mean to a particular person; How do their boundaries and names change over time and from person to person. 

Questions like these have fascinated me. 
I conducted in 2010-12, by bicycling around Cleveland, asking people 
my first map was of Cleveland's neighborhoods. 

In Cleveland, neighborhoods' boundaries are largely left to the imaginations of residents, visitors, realtors, and businesses. 

I'm presenting an exercise in mapping for fun: allowing each of you to say where your neighborhood is. 


You're encouraged to map (that is draw) the neighborhood where you live but also others that you may not live in but may spend a lot of time in or feel strongly about. 

A map is not just a static representation of outsides, 

but this is to map as a verb: you can not only 




I've also added Akron's as well, prompted by a converation with Jason Segedy.  

Thanks to work of [Andy Woodruff](http://bostonography.com/2015/map-your-neighborhood-again/); and [Nick Martinelli](http://pnwmaps.com/neighborhoods/). I've been able to build upon their work; 


If you're a developer and wish to implement this in your own city, the source code is available on [github](https://github.com/enam/neighborhoods/)
