(Wow, time flies. More than 2 years since my last post?)

What I've been up to recently, personally and professionally. 

A lot more deserves to be said. 

The election was troubling. It's the feeling that people will be hurt as a result of his policies and while after being politically involved in college, a jadedness had taken form. But life for many people is changing for the worse. 


There's been a big hot take from Cleveland identity: 

Do I still identify as a Clevelander? Yes. Do I live in the city proper? For the first time that I've lived in Cleveland area, no. 

Now, I still give really care about the city's future. It's why I devote so much time and energy to Open Cleveland. 

I really appreciate the culture of the Cleveland Public Library. It's not perfect but 
damn.
