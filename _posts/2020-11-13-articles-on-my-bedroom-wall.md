(This has been sitting in my drafts folder for months; I need to just post!)

As a teenager in the early/mid 2000s, I cut out my favorite articles from print publications (Plain Dealer - the daily newspaper in Cleveland, or the Free Times, the Scene (the local alt. weeklies), or the New York Times - I had a subscription when I was home from college); I would then glue them onto poster board and then hang them up on my bedroom wall using sticky tack or push pins. 

I don't know where I got the idea for this; I don't claim to be the original. 

While cleaning, I found some of these and decided to document them before I threw them out.

(As a part of my effort to document my life on my blog instead of just on twitter, I've posted this here.)
