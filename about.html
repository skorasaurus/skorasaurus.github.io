  <p>Hi, I'm Will Skora. This is another iteration of my blogging and personal website that has existed in one way or another since the early 2000s.</p>

  <p> I'm interested in web maps, particularly of urban areas, transportation, infrastructure, and open data. I live in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
  <p> Professionally, I'm a web developer at the <a href="https://cpl.org">Cleveland Public Library </a></p>. 
  <p> The views and opinions on this website only represent me and do not represent Cleveland Public Library in any capacity. </p>
  <p> I'm available for consultation on web maps, web mapping, web accessibility, and navigating the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. Email me [skorasaurus@gmail.com]. </p> 

  <p> See the side bar for my other web presences; below is some of my professional work. </p>
