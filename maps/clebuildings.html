    <h1>The age of Cleveland Buildings</h1>
 <p>Some observations: </p>
    <p> During the 1930s, the rate of new building construction plummeted and left several streets like <a href="#" data-zoom="17" data-position="41.445227,-81.808204"> West 158th St. </a> to have adjacent houses built 10-15 years apart from each other. </p>
    <p> 
    Those unfamiliar with the East side will be surprised to see the several small pockets of market-rate housing
    built during the 1990s including 
    <a href="#" data-zoom="16" data-position="41.495352,-81.661044">
      East 36th-38th between Central and Community College </a> and 
    <a href="#" data-zoom="17" data-position="41.504627,-81.628761"> East 82nd-87th, between Chester and Euclid
     </a> </p> <p>
     Also, there's some of my favorite (newly-built) homes in Cleveland, a small block of some dense housing right in Downtown, on 
    <a href="#" data-zoom="18" data-position="41.505316,-81.683604"> 13th and Lindazzo. </a> They were built in 07 and with the housing market crashing, any other pending construction there was likely postponed...
</p>

     <p> The raw data for further analysis is available at <a href="http://github.com/skorasaurus/clebuildings"> http://github.com/skorasaurus/clebuildings</p> <p> </a> Data was provided by NEOCANDO/NST. I don't know how they acquired it, likely from scraping the <a href="http://fiscalofficer.cuyahogacounty.us/AuditorApps/real-property/REPI/default.asp"> county auditor website</a>. Notes/Errata: Some CMHA residential buildings (Outhwaite and 55th, Woodland and Bundy) are only counted (and mapped) as a single building in the dataset although there's several individual buildings there. This is because the county classifies these buildings to be on a single land parcel and assign one building date for each parcel.</p>
