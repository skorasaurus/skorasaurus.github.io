Here's a portfolio of online maps that I've made or significantly contributed towards. I'm particularly fond of slippy maps and urban areas where people and infrastructure interesect and how they are represented.

Online slippy maps, which offer multiple zoom levels, enable cartographer to create visualizations from multiple perspectives (if they so desire) and enable the map reader to see an area in multiple ways that they haven't imagined.

I primarily use Mapbox and leaflet for the map interaction. For the map design, I use a combination of tools: TileMill, Mapbox Studio, Carto, QGIS, and Mapzen's Tangrams. The source code for these are all available, as indicated in the links below.

[View the 2020 Presidential results of Cuyahoga County](2020-cuyahoga-presidential-results/index.html)

A map displaying the percentage of votes for 2020 Presidential Election, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio by electoral precinct (the enumeration unit). I purposefully chose to highlight the variability of the Biden support thoroughout Cuyahoga County. and I was also on a self-imposed time pressure to publish this shortly after the election (published a few days after the 2020 Election)
Not my best work but received a fair amount of positive publicity on social media and [cited in the local alt-weekly, the Cleveland Scene](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518071816/https://www.clevescene.com/news/how-did-your-precinct-in-cuyahoga-county-vote-in-the-presidential-election-this-map-will-tell-you-34693781).
